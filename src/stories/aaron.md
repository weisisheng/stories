story: "A Florida-native, Aaron Natoniewski fell in love with the rugged Western Slope lifestyle so much so it's where he decided to start a family â€” and no ordinary family at that. He lives with his wife, two young daughters, and 14 dogs.    
From adopting shelter dogs to learning how to run with them on a sled, Aaron took an impromptu but determined leap into the world of competitive dog sledding. A natural talent on the sled, Aaron has an ability to form meaningful relationships with each dog and an endless appreciation of this special pack. In his eyes, how they work together is the definition of beauty.
