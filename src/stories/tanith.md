story: "Ever since Tanith Martinez was a young girl she wanted to fly. Fast forward twenty years and Tanith is soaring the skies of the Western Slope in her own Cessna 182, operating and instructing out of one of the highest elevation airports in Colorado. An accomplished pilot, business owner, and mom, Tanith is the real-deal embodiment of “if you can dream it, you can do it”. Navigating through the mountain peaks at 10,000 ft with her daughter Atlee in the co-pilot seat, Tanith has made her childhood dream come true."
