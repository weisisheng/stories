story: "After retiring, Ron Black founded the San Juan Dance Club as a way to keep busy. Dancing everything from the waltz to the Cowboy Cha Cha, word spread quickly of the fun being had and soon couples and eligible singles from across the Western Slope were showing up to Ron’s weekly classes. Creating an atmosphere in which two people can find each other is the true magic of the dance club. Through the San Juan Dance Club, Ron has given the town of Montrose a reason to dance."
