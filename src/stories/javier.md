**Javier de los Santos**' love for the guitar has taken him across the globe on a journey that hasn’t been an easy one. Only through years of tireless practice and dedication has he been invited to perform classical guitar from the Southwest to Spain to South America.<!-- endexcerpt -->

According to Javier, “my spirit gets fulfilled through the sounds of the guitar.” Javier calls Grand Junction home after years studying with maestros from the Académica de Música in Zacatecas, México and the University of Denver’s Lamont School of Music. He founded and performs with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/mariachisanjose.gj/about/?ref=page_internal" target="_blank">Mariachi San Jose</a>, sharing traditional music and building upon the rich musical heritage of the Western Slope. 

He shares his gift as an <a href="https://www.coloradomesa.edu/directory/music/javier-de-los-santos.html" target="_blank">instructor at Colorado Mesa University</a> and as President & Artistic Director of the Western Colorado Classical Guitar Society, as well as through local school guitar programs. 

His first professor told him, “Whatever you play, Javier, play it with your heart.” Whether making music with his family, teaching a master class, or performing with his local Mariachi band, those words have never left Javier’s heart or hands.
