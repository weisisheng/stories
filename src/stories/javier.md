title: "The Journey"
story: "Javier de los Santos’ love for the guitar has taken him across the globe, yet the journey hasn’t been an easy one.  Only through years of tireless practice and dedication has he been invited to perform classical guitar from Maine to Texas, Granada to Rio de Janiero, and in Spain, Mexico and throughout Colorado.
According to Javier, “somehow, my spirit gets fulfilled through the sounds of the guitar,” and he shares this gift as an instructor at Colorado Mesa University, the Aspen Music Festival, local school guitar programs and as President & Artistic Director of the Western Colorado Classical Guitar Society. 
Javier calls Grand Junction home after years studying with maestros from the Académica de Música in Zacatecas, México to the University of Denver’s Lamont School of Music.  Here, he founded and performs with Mariachi San Jose sharing traditional music and continuing to build upon the rich musical heritage of the Western Slope. 
His first professor once told him, “Whatever you play, Javier, play it with your heart.” Whether making music with his family, teaching a master class or performing with his local Mariachi band, those words have never left Javier’s heart or hands."
